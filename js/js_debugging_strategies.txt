/* debugging strategies
debugging level 1 => check if JS syntax is correct (check console in Web Dev )
debugging level 2 => check if the targeting is working (check the connection between the HTML element and equivalent JS functionality ==> alert("here"); inside the function)
debugging level 3 => check if the logic makes sense (check if the JS functionality returns what we expect ==> alert alert(VALUE-NAME); inside the function)

Check the variable, object flow between the functions

Check the final output
