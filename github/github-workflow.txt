Initial Cycle (create the repository ON THE SERVER and then clone it locally)
    github.com -> create repository
    github.com -> clone repository on own computer using the command line or the Github Desktop UI Software




Daily Cycle (commit changes and syncronize)
    Note: Run the following command inside the repository folder

    //prepack the code
    1) git add . ;
        --> means add all the files to be pre-packed for the commit in that particular folder
    2) git commit -m 'Some message for you future self explaining why is this commit important';
        --> means commit is happening only on the local machine (no communication with the server possible); -m stand for a message (it is a message to self about the content of that commit; example: changing the header color)

    //send it to the server
    3) git pull origin master;
        --> means download all the code from the server and make sure there are no conflict with your own code
    4) git push --set-upstream origin master;
        --> means synchronise your own code with the server


    All commands on one line shortcut:
    git add . ; git commit -m 'REPLACE-ME'; git pull origin master; git push --set-upstream origin master




When to commit code to the server?
    -> when a particular part of the code is completed (let's say the footer is ready)
    -> at the end of the day (but only if the code is fully functional and has no bugs)




Master and branches

-> Master (in production environment this is the live website)
        --> branch_1 (some branch to test something)
        --> gh-pages (in Github this is the live website)
