Initial Cycle (create the repository ON THE SERVER and clone it localy )
	github.com -> create repository
	github.com -> clone repository on own computer into command line (Github Desktop UI Software)
	

Daily Cycle (commit changes and syncronize)
	inside the repository folder
	
	//prepack the code
	1) git add . ;  //add all the files to be pre-packed for the commit in that particular folder	
	2) git commit -m 'Some message';  //commit is happening only on the local machine (no communication with the server possible); -m stand for a message (it is a message to self about the content of that commit; example: changing the header color)
	
	//send it to the server
	3) git pull origin master; //download all the code from the server and make sure there are no conflict with your own code	
	4) git push --set-upstream origin master //synchronise your own code with the server
	
	
	shortcut
	git add . ; git commit -m 'Initial Commit'; git pull origin master; git push --set-upstream origin master
